# Note: In the code, if the data type is not supported,
# you'll have to deal yourself (by editing global_config.py likely)

# Also, at the moment, these aren't type safe, so if you use this file in other cogs,
# make sure to use the correct getter function for the type you expect it to be. (and cast!)
