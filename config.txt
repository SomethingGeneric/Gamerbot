# This is a comment!
# Note: In the code, if the data type is not supported,
# you'll have to deal yourself (by editing global_config.py likely)

# Also, at the moment, these aren't type safe, so if you use this file in other cogs,
# make sure to use the correct getter function for the type you expect it to be. (and cast!)

# General bot stuff

# Types: watching, listening, playing
DEFAULT_STATUS_TYPE:playing

# These are currently the only substitutions
# - {number_users}
# - {guild_count}
DEFAULT_STATUS_TEXT:in {guild_count} servers

# Any default cogs you don't want to load:
# Example: UNLOAD_COGS:Internet,Speak
# Or maybe more likely: UNLOAD_COGS:Shells
# Blank is fine, too

# NEED TO CHANGE
# Paste service stuff
# The user running the bot needs write acces to below path (for saving pastes)

# Text for messages:
# Note {command} is the only substitution allowed here (we do auto-mention the user)
WRONG_PERMS:You're not a special snowflake, so you can't run `{command}`

# {username} is the only one here
NEW_MEMBER:Welcome, {username}

# and {channel} is the only one here
INTRO_CHANNEL:You should go to {channel}, since it's your first time here.
